        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="date"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 12, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction and Commitment to Privacy</h2>
        <p>PureWall (referred to as "we," "us," "our," or "the App") is committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, who we share it with, and what rights you have regarding your personal information. By downloading, installing, or using PureWall, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and agree to its terms. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use our App.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Privacy-First Design:</strong> PureWall is designed with privacy in mind. We do not require you to create an account, we do not collect personal information such as your name or email address, and your favorite wallpapers are stored locally on your device only. We believe you should have control over your data.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>It is important to understand what we do not collect. PureWall does not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, phone number, physical address, or payment information. We do not require you to create an account or log in to use the App. We do not track your precise geographic location. We do not access your contacts, camera, microphone, or other sensitive device features. We do not store your favorite wallpapers on our servers or sync them across devices.</p>

        <h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Information Stored Locally on Your Device</h3>
        <p>Certain information is stored locally on your device using standard mobile application storage mechanisms. This includes your favorite wallpapers which are saved using SharedPreferences and remain on your device only, your app preferences and settings, and downloaded wallpaper files which are saved to your device's Photos app or Camera Roll. This locally stored information is under your control and is deleted when you uninstall the App. We have no access to this local data as it never leaves your device.</p>

        <h3>7.2 Anonymous Usage Analytics</h3>
        <p>We collect anonymous usage analytics through Firebase Analytics, a service provided by Google, to understand how users interact with PureWall and to improve the App's functionality and user experience. This information is collected automatically and includes device information such as device model, operating system version, app version, screen resolution, and device language settings. Usage patterns collected include which wallpaper categories you browse, which wallpapers you view or download, how long you spend in the App, which features you use most frequently, and crash reports and error logs to help us identify and fix technical issues. All analytics data is anonymized and aggregated, meaning we cannot identify individual users from this information.</p>

        <h3>7.3 Trending System Data</h3>
        <p>PureWall features a trending system that displays popular wallpapers based on community activity. This system uses anonymous global counters stored in Firebase Firestore. When you download a wallpaper, we increment an anonymous download counter for that specific wallpaper. When you add a wallpaper to your favorites, we increment an anonymous favorite counter for that wallpaper. These counters are completely anonymous and contain no information about individual users. We cannot determine who downloaded or favorited any particular wallpaper. The trending algorithm calculates popularity scores using the formula of downloads plus favorites multiplied by two, and displays the most popular wallpapers to all users. No user identification, tracking, or profiling occurs through the trending system.</p>

        <h3>7.4 Subscription Information</h3>
        <p>If you subscribe to PureWall Premium through the Apple App Store, your subscription is managed entirely by Apple through your Apple ID. We verify your subscription status through Apple's servers to determine whether you should have access to Premium features. We do not collect, store, or process any payment information such as credit card numbers or billing addresses. All payment processing, billing, and subscription management is handled by Apple according to their privacy practices. We only receive a verification from Apple indicating whether you have an active Premium subscription associated with your Apple ID.</p>

        <h3>3.5 Advertising Data</h3>
        <p>Free users of PureWall are shown rewarded video advertisements powered by Google AdMob. AdMob collects certain information to display relevant advertisements and measure ad performance. This includes your device's advertising identifier, information about your interactions with advertisements such as impressions and clicks, technical information necessary to serve ads such as device type and network connectivity, and information used to personalize advertisements based on your interests if you have not opted out of personalized advertising. Google's use of advertising data is governed by their privacy policy. You can opt out of personalized advertising through your iOS device settings by going to Settings, Privacy & Security, Tracking, and disabling tracking for PureWall or all apps. Premium subscribers do not see advertisements and therefore no advertising data is collected for Premium users.</p>

        <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>

        <h3>7.1 Providing and Maintaining the Service</h3>
        <p>We use the information we collect to operate PureWall and provide you with access to our wallpaper collection. This includes delivering wallpaper content to your device, verifying your Premium subscription status if applicable, enabling the favorites feature through local storage on your device, calculating and displaying trending wallpapers based on anonymous community data, and ensuring the App functions correctly across different devices and operating system versions.</p>

        <h3>7.2 Improving the App</h3>
        <p>Anonymous analytics help us understand how users interact with PureWall so we can make improvements. We use this information to identify which wallpaper categories are most popular so we can add similar content, understand which features users find most valuable, detect and fix technical issues and crashes, optimize app performance and loading times, and make informed decisions about future features and updates. All analysis is performed on aggregated, anonymous data and we cannot identify individual users.</p>

        <h3>7.3 Displaying Advertisements</h3>
        <p>For free users, we use advertising data collected by Google AdMob to display rewarded video advertisements that allow you to download wallpapers. The advertising system uses the collected data to show relevant advertisements, measure ad performance and engagement, prevent fraud and invalid ad traffic, and comply with advertising industry standards and regulations. Premium subscribers do not see advertisements and therefore this use of data does not apply to them.</p>

        <h3>7.4 Legal Compliance</h3>
        <p>We may use or disclose information when required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. However, because we collect minimal personal information, we have very little data that could be subject to such requests.</p>

        <h2>5. Information Sharing and Third-Party Services</h2>

        <h3>7.1 Firebase Services</h3>
        <p>We use Firebase, a platform provided by Google LLC, for several purposes. Firebase Analytics collects anonymous usage data as described in Section 3.2. Firebase Firestore stores the anonymous trending counters described in Section 3.3. Firebase Storage hosts the wallpaper images you can download through the App. Firebase Crashlytics collects crash reports to help us identify and fix technical issues. Firebase services are governed by Google's Privacy Policy available at https://policies.google.com/privacy and Firebase's specific privacy information available at https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy. Google may use the data collected through Firebase in accordance with their privacy practices.</p>

        <h3>7.2 Google AdMob</h3>
        <p>Free users see rewarded video advertisements powered by Google AdMob. AdMob is an advertising service provided by Google LLC. As described in Section 3.5, AdMob collects certain information to display and measure advertisements. Google's use of advertising data is governed by their Privacy Policy at https://policies.google.com/privacy and their EU User Consent Policy. You can learn more about how Google uses data from apps that use their services at https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites. You can opt out of personalized advertising through your iOS device settings as described in Section 3.5.</p>

        <h3>7.3 Apple App Store and Subscription Services</h3>
        <p>Premium subscriptions are processed and managed by Apple Inc. through the Apple App Store. We use Apple's subscription verification system to check whether you have an active Premium subscription. Apple collects and processes subscription information, payment information, and billing data according to their Privacy Policy available at https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy. We do not receive or have access to your payment information or other personal information you provide to Apple. We only receive confirmation of your subscription status.</p>

        <h3>7.4 No Other Third-Party Sharing</h3>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your information with third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy. We do not share data with data brokers or advertising networks other than Google AdMob as described above. We do not use your data for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>

        <h3>7.1 Local Data Storage</h3>
        <p>Your favorite wallpapers and app settings are stored exclusively on your device using standard iOS storage mechanisms such as SharedPreferences. This data never leaves your device and we have no access to it. When you download a wallpaper to your device's Photos app or Camera Roll, it is stored locally on your device according to iOS storage policies. All locally stored data is deleted when you uninstall PureWall.</p>

        <h3>7.2 Cloud Data Storage</h3>
        <p>The only data we store in the cloud consists of wallpaper images hosted on Firebase Storage which are publicly accessible to all users, and anonymous trending counters in Firebase Firestore containing download and favorite counts per wallpaper with no user identification. These cloud-stored items contain no personal information and cannot be linked to individual users.</p>

        <h3>7.3 Data Security</h3>
        <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect the limited data we collect. This includes using secure HTTPS connections for all data transmission, relying on Firebase's security infrastructure which includes encryption at rest and in transit, implementing best practices for mobile app security, and regularly updating our App to address security vulnerabilities. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Because we collect minimal personal information and store favorites locally on your device only, the risk of a data breach affecting your privacy is significantly reduced.</p>

        <h3>7.4 Data Retention</h3>
        <p>Locally stored data including favorites and settings remains on your device until you delete the App. Anonymous analytics data is retained by Firebase according to Google's data retention policies, typically aggregated and anonymized over time. Trending counters in Firebase Firestore are maintained indefinitely as they are anonymous global statistics with no expiration needed. If you uninstall PureWall, all locally stored data is immediately deleted from your device. Anonymous analytics and trending data cannot be linked back to you and therefore cannot be deleted on a per-user basis.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>

        <h3>7.1 Access to Your Information</h3>
        <p>Because PureWall does not collect personally identifiable information, there is no personal data for you to access or review through our systems. Your favorites and settings are stored locally on your device and you have full access to them through the App interface. You can view your favorites, modify your settings, and manage your local data at any time through the App.</p>

        <h3>7.2 Deleting Your Information</h3>
        <p>You can delete your locally stored favorites at any time through the App's favorites screen by removing individual wallpapers or clearing all favorites. You can clear all locally cached images through the App's menu by selecting the "Clear Cache" option. Uninstalling PureWall will immediately delete all locally stored data including favorites, settings, and cached images from your device. Because we do not store personal information on our servers and trending counters are anonymous, there is no server-side user data to delete.</p>

        <h3>7.3 Opting Out of Advertising</h3>
        <p>You can control personalized advertising on your iOS device by going to Settings, Privacy & Security, Tracking, and disabling tracking for PureWall specifically or all apps generally. This will limit personalized advertising but you will still see non-personalized advertisements as a free user. Alternatively, you can subscribe to PureWall Premium to remove all advertisements entirely and enjoy an ad-free experience with unlimited downloads.</p>

        <h3>7.4 Analytics Opt-Out</h3>
        <p>iOS provides system-level privacy controls that may limit analytics collection. You can review and modify these settings in your device's Settings app under Privacy & Security. Note that disabling analytics may impact our ability to identify and fix bugs or improve app performance.</p>

        <h3>7.5 Managing Your Subscription</h3>
        <p>If you have a Premium subscription, you can manage it through your Apple ID settings. To view, modify, or cancel your subscription, go to Settings on your iOS device, tap your name at the top, tap Subscriptions, select PureWall, and follow the instructions. All subscription management including billing, payment methods, and cancellation is handled by Apple according to their policies.</p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>PureWall requires users to be at least thirteen years of age. This age requirement exists not because of the nature of our content, which is appropriate for all ages, but because of legal requirements related to data collection, analytics, advertising, and in-app purchases. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under thirteen years of age. Our App does not target children under thirteen. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child under thirteen has used PureWall and we have collected information from them, please contact us immediately at support@purewall.app and we will take steps to remove any such information and prevent further access. Parents and guardians should monitor their children's use of mobile applications and ensure appropriate age restrictions are enabled on their devices.</p>

        <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>PureWall is available globally and the services we use, including Firebase and Google AdMob, may store and process data in various countries. By using PureWall, you acknowledge that your information may be transferred to and stored in countries other than your country of residence, including the United States where Firebase and Google services are primarily hosted. These countries may have data protection laws that differ from the laws of your country. However, because we collect minimal personal information and most data is stored locally on your device, international data transfer concerns are limited. Where data is transferred internationally, Firebase and Google implement appropriate safeguards as described in their privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>10. California Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p>If you are a California resident, you have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). However, because PureWall does not collect personal information as defined by the CCPA, these rights may not apply in practice. For clarity, we do not sell your personal information to third parties. We do not share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising beyond what is described in our use of Google AdMob for free users, which you can opt out of as described in Section 7.3. If you have questions about your California privacy rights, please contact us at support@purewall.app.</p>

        <h2>11. European Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or Switzerland, you have certain rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and similar laws. These rights include the right to access your personal data, the right to rectification of inaccurate data, the right to erasure in certain circumstances, the right to restrict processing, the right to data portability, and the right to object to processing. However, because PureWall collects minimal personal information and stores favorites locally on your device only, these rights may not apply in practice. The legal basis for our data processing includes your consent when you use the App and agree to this Privacy Policy, our legitimate interests in operating and improving the App, and compliance with legal obligations. If you have questions about your European privacy rights or wish to exercise them, please contact us at support@purewall.app.</p>

        <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or App features. When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we make material changes that significantly affect your privacy rights, we will notify you through the App or other appropriate means before the changes take effect. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information. Your continued use of PureWall after changes to this Privacy Policy become effective constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

        <h2>13. Third-Party Links</h2>
        <p>PureWall may contain links to third-party websites or services, such as the privacy policies of Firebase, Google, and Apple referenced in this document. This Privacy Policy applies only to PureWall and not to any third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any third-party websites or services you visit.</p>

        <h2>14. Data Protection Officer</h2>
        <p>Given the minimal nature of data collection in PureWall and our company size, we have not appointed a formal Data Protection Officer. However, all privacy-related inquiries, requests, and concerns should be directed to support@purewall.app and will be handled promptly by our team.</p>

        <h2>15. Your Consent</h2>
        <p>By downloading, installing, and using PureWall, you consent to the collection, use, and sharing of information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use our App. You may withdraw your consent at any time by uninstalling the App, which will delete all locally stored data from your device.</p>

        <h2>16. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at:</p>
